    "The power of Python comes in part from its extensive selection of libraries (often called packages). Pandas is one of these, but for many applications you will want to use additional packages such as numpy or scikit-learn for statistical testing or machine learning. This section will not cover all possibilities (which would make this section longer than the rest of the course) but will start assuming that you have looked up your target analysis and the word \"Python\" and found a package to use. At this point you will know something like \"I want to use the function called 'LinearRegression' in the package scikit-learn\". This module will walk you through how to figure out how to use a function, and, specifically, how to use it with Pandas.\n",
